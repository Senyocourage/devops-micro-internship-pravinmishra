# Assignment 4 — Building Your AI Team

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build and configure a set of specialized AI subagents inside your project. You will learn how different models and tool permissions define agent behavior, and you will trigger two real agent delegations to analyze security and cost aspects of your Terraform infrastructure.

# Task 1 — Create the Agents Folder and Add Files

## Goal

Create the `.claude/agents/` directory and add all required agent files.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — VS Code sidebar showing `.claude/agents/` with all 3 files

# Task 2 — Compare the Agent Configurations

## Goal

Analyze the configuration differences between the three agents and demonstrate understanding of model and tool selection.

### Written Answers

#### 1. Why does the cost optimizer use Haiku instead of Sonnet?

The cost optimizer uses the Haiku model because its tasks involve simple and efficient analysis, such as reviewing Terraform configurations and suggesting ways to reduce costs. These tasks do not require advanced reasoning, so Haiku is preferred because it provides faster responses while using fewer resources compared to Sonnet.

---

#### 2. Why does the security auditor NOT have Write in its tools list?

The security auditor is only responsible for reviewing and analyzing Terraform files to identify security issues. It does not need permission to make changes, so removing the Write tool helps prevent unintended modifications and ensures the principle of least privilege is followed.

---

#### 3. Why does the tf-writer use `inherit` instead of a specific model?

The Terraform writer uses inherit because it needs to adapt to the default Claude Code model settings. This provides flexibility by allowing it to use the configured model automatically rather than being restricted to a specific model, which is useful for generating and updating infrastructure code.

# Task 3 — Run the Security Auditor

## Goal

Trigger the security auditor agent and analyze the generated security report for your Terraform infrastructure.

### Evidence

# Task 4 — Run the Cost Optimizer

## Goal

Trigger the cost optimizer agent and review the generated cost optimization report.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — The full cost optimization report
